Q1:
CONCURRENCY
Concurrency is running multiple tasks at the same time but not simultaneoulsy.It means application is making progress on more then one task at the same time.
Concurrency uses single Processing unit to perform multiple tasks.
 In Concurrency, you have concurrent accesses to one or more shared resources in a system.
There is switching over the tasks.
PARALLELISM
Parallelism is act of running multiple tasks simultaneously.In Parallelism an application splits its tasks into smaller subtasks which can be processed in parallel.
Parallelsim uses Multiple processing units to perform tasks.
There is no switching over the tasks.

Q2:
STOP EXECUTION OF A PROCESS
To stop execution of a running process we use a command:
$ KILL –STOP <PID>
PID is process ID before we stop execution of a running process we have to find its process ID.We can find process ID by using a command:
$ ps
This command shows all the running processes in the system with their process IDs.After finding process ID we use KILL –STOP <PID> command to stop our background process.
The process is as follows:
$ ps (found PID)
$ KILL –STOP 12345 (12345=PID)
The execution of process stops after this command.To see the processes again use $ ps command.
If we want to resume execution we can resume it by a command $KILL –CONT <PID>.This command resume the execution of process.You can again see the process running by using $ ps command.
We can also use $KILL -19 <PID>
Q3:
CHANGE REFRESH TIME
We use Delay command to refresh default time the command is:
$ TOP –d time in sec
We want to set time 10 sec so:
$ TOP –d 10
This command changes the default refresh time from 2 sec to 10 sec.
Q4:
There were 15 child processes.
Hello prints 30 times.
Exit prints 16 times.
